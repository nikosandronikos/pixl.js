# pixl.js
Renderer for (primarily) 2d pixel graphics games built on [Pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/).

I'm building this as a component of a spaceship battle game, which is at:
https://github.com/nikosandronikos/spacebattle

# Dependencies
Requires the [2dGameUtils](https://github.com/nikosandronikos/2dGameUtils) library, which must be located in
the same directory that this project is checked out into.

So, to get both, run the following from the directory where you want your copies of the repositories to live.
```
git clone https://github.com/nikosandronikos/pixl.js.git
git clone https://github.com/nikosandronikos/2dGameUtils.git
```
